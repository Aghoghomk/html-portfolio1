<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>A graduate of engineering with technical knowledge of mechanics and engineering sciences, to
  solve important engineering problems. A Skilled welder with over two years in stick welding, drill
  press, and metal fabrication. A bricklayer with over ten years of experience in building and
  construction of private and public buildings.</p>

<p><h3>Projects</h3>
  <h3>CFD Modelling of Bend Pipe Erosion under Multiphase Flow Regimes
  2023 Project Originator, Team size 1.</h3> 
 <ol> <li>Use computational fluid dynamics (CFD), to acquire fundamental insights into sand erosion in
  curved oil and gas pipelines.</li>
  <li>Explore and test CFD multiphase flow to decide its ability to simulate different
  multiphasic flow condition in pipe bend.</li>
  <li>Study of the mechanisms of destruction of the pipe curve, uneven distribution of flow
  rate can lead to high pressure at the intrados segment, which can lead to high local pressure
  (literature review).</li>
  <li>Parameterization of the flow with a literature review</li>
  <li>Simulation of bend pipe (using FEA Fluent)</li>
  <li>Verification of the use of relevant data and/or a review of the turbulent flow literature to verify
  the flow behaviour.</li></ol>
